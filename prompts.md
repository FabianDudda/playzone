I have a weird behaviour, when adding a court to the map on /courts/new:

- the map re-renders everytime, when:
1. user inputs a character in the input fields
2. user select/deselect a sport
3. user clicks on the map

Describe my written behaviour in your own words, so that i know you understood me correct
